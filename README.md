# Orient-Joint
I create this simple tool that can orient joints with more options and a faster way, so you can have a very specific adjust. 

You can see a little demonstration on who the tool works.
The tool doesn't create history when you are changing the joints orientation and will keep (translation, rotation, and scale) clear.
